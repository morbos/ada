Test of the ADC on the WL. Using the svd2ada svd files from ST's
SWM32WL5x_CM4.svd file, it produced a variant record for CHSELx as
that field is selected by a mode bit in another reg.

When building using CHSEL1 as the discriminator choice (Val_1) the
code gets a compiler error:

In gcc
gcc-14.1.0/gcc/ada/exp_ch4.adb:10858
            if not Is_Unchecked_Union
                    (Implementation_Base_Type (Etype (Prefix (N))))
              and then not Is_Predefined_Unit (Get_Source_Unit (N))
            then
               Error_Msg_N
---->>          ("sorry - unable to generate discriminant check for" &
                    " reference to variant component &",
                  Selector_Name (N));
            end if;

To work around was to comment out that discriminant check.
CHSELRx are overlays selected by a mode bit. Mode1, CHSELR1 is the mode
that Adacores lib is set up for so we just remove the choice.

I tried many work arounds, no matter what I did, the Discriminent(sic)
value below was always Val_0 (even with the default set to
Val_1). Also, to get the 'sorry' error message to go away I had to
remove the Unchecked_Union aspect. No clue why that message was
emitted. Lots I don't understand here.

   --  Analog to digital convertor
   type ADC_Peripheral
--     (Discriminent : ADC_Disc := Val_1)
   is record
...
--      case Discriminent is
--         when Val_0 =>
--  channel selection register
--            CHSELR0 : aliased CHSELR0_Register;
--         when Val_1 =>
--  channel selection register
      CHSELR1 : aliased CHSELR1_Register;
--      end case;
   end record
     with Volatile;
--     with Unchecked_Union, Volatile;
