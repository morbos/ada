This is the door code running on the All in One board (aio).
It performs these steps: (BKP are the backup registers).
   --  0) Check if we have calibrated if so goto 3), otherwise mark BKP as initialized
   --  1) Cal door closed
   --     throw 1st reading away
   --     in 5sec, read 5 times and take the avg
   --  2) Mark the BKP rams with a) a magic b) 3 axis avg of closed c) curr stance (closed)
   --  3) Every :30 seconds, power up the mag take a reading, make a decision based on xyz and current stance
   --  4) if door stance is open, every :30min send a pkt
