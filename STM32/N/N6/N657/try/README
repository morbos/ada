First pass at an Ada program on the N6. This uses the Nucleo board
with its on board STLINK. As shipped, the bootstrap is set to
'development', the upshot of that is, the part drops into your code as
secure. This is why all the libs and RTL are _s/_S.

There is a tonne, and I mean a tonne of further work to get this
target into usable shape.
