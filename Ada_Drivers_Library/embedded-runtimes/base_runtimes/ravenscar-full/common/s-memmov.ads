--  This package provides a general block copy mechanism analogous to that
--  provided by the C routine memmove allowing for copies with overlap.

   --  Copies N storage units from area starting at Src to area starting
   --  at Dest without any check for buffer overflow. The difference between
   --  this memmove and memcpy is that with memmove, the storage areas may
   --  overlap (forwards or backwards) and the result is correct (i.e. it
   --  is as if Src is first moved to a temporary area, and then this area
   --  is copied to Dst in a separate step).
