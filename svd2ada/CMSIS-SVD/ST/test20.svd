              <description>Bus turnaround phase duration These bits
              are written by software to add a delay at the end of
              a write-to-read or read-to write transaction. The
              programmed bus turnaround delay is inserted between
              an asynchronous read (in muxed or mode D) or write
              transaction and any other asynchronous /synchronous
              read/write from/to a static bank. If a read operation
              is performed, the bank can be the same or a different
              one, whereas it must be different in case of write
              operation to the bank, except in muxed mode or mode
              D. In some cases, whatever the programmed BUSTRUN
              values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as follows:
              The bus turnaround delay is not inserted between two
              consecutive asynchronous write transfers to the same
              static memory bank except in muxed mode and mode D.
              There is a bus turnaround delay of 1 FMC clock cycle
              between: Two consecutive asynchronous read transfers
              to the same static memory bank except for modes muxed
              and D. An asynchronous read to an asynchronous or
              synchronous write to any static bank or dynamic bank
              except in modes muxed and D mode. There is a bus
              turnaround delay of 2 FMC clock cycle between: Two
              consecutive synchronous write operations (in Burst or
              Single mode) to the same bank. A synchronous write
              (burst or single) access and an asynchronous write or
              read transfer to or from static memory bank (the bank
              can be the same or a different one in case of a read
              operation. Two consecutive synchronous read
              operations (in Burst or Single mode) followed by any
              synchronous/asynchronous read or write from/to
              another static memory bank. There is a bus turnaround
              delay of 3 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive
              synchronous write operations (in Burst or Single
              mode) to different static banks. A synchronous write
              access (in Burst or Single mode) and a synchronous
              read from the same or a different bank. The bus
              turnaround delay allows to match the minimum time
              between consecutive transactions (tEHEL from NEx high
              to NEx low) and the maximum time required by the
              memory to free the data bus after a read access
              (tEHQZ): (BUSTRUN + 1) KCK_FMC period &amp;#8805;
              tEHELmin and (BUSTRUN + 2)KCK_FMC period &amp;#8805;

              <description>Bus turnaround phase duration These bits
              are written by software to add a delay at the end of
              a write-to-read or read-to write transaction. The
              programmed bus turnaround delay is inserted between
              an asynchronous read (in muxed or mode D) or write
              transaction and any other asynchronous /synchronous
              read/write from/to a static bank. If a read operation
              is performed, the bank can be the same or a different
              one, whereas it must be different in case of write
              operation to the bank, except in muxed mode or mode
              D. In some cases, whatever the programmed BUSTRUN
              values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as follows:
              The bus turnaround delay is not inserted between two
              consecutive asynchronous write transfers to the same
              static memory bank except in muxed mode and mode D.
              There is a bus turnaround delay of 1 FMC clock cycle
              between: Two consecutive asynchronous read transfers
              to the same static memory bank except for modes muxed
              and D. An asynchronous read to an asynchronous or
              synchronous write to any static bank or dynamic bank
              except in modes muxed and D mode. There is a bus
              turnaround delay of 2 FMC clock cycle between: Two
              consecutive synchronous write operations (in Burst or
              Single mode) to the same bank. A synchronous write
              (burst or single) access and an asynchronous write or
              read transfer to or from static memory bank (the bank
              can be the same or a different one in case of a read
              operation. Two consecutive synchronous read
              operations (in Burst or Single mode) followed by any
              synchronous/asynchronous read or write from/to
              another static memory bank. There is a bus turnaround
              delay of 3 FMC clock cycle between: Two consecutive
              synchronous write operations (in Burst or Single
              mode) to different static banks. A synchronous write
              access (in Burst or Single mode) and a synchronous
              read from the same or a different bank. The bus
              turnaround delay allows to match the minimum time
              between consecutive transactions (tEHEL from NEx high
              to NEx low) and the maximum time required by the
              memory to free the data bus after a read access
              (tEHQZ): (BUSTRUN + 1) KCK_FMC period &amp;#8805;

              are written by software to add a delay at the end of
              a write-to-read or read-to write transaction. The
              programmed bus turnaround delay is inserted between
              an asynchronous read (in muxed or mode D) or write
              transaction and any other asynchronous /synchronous
              read/write from/to a static bank. If a read operation
              is performed, the bank can be the same or a different
              one, whereas it must be different in case of write
              operation to the bank, except in muxed mode or mode
              D. In some cases, whatever the programmed BUSTRUN
              values, the bus turnaround delay is fixed as follows:
              The bus turnaround delay is not inserted between two
              consecutive asynchronous write transfers to the same
              static memory bank except in muxed mode and mode D.
              There is a bus turnaround delay of 1 FMC clock cycle
              between: Two consecutive asynchronous read transfers
              to the same static memory bank except for modes muxed
              and D. An asynchronous read to an asynchronous or
              synchronous write to any static bank or dynamic bank
              except in modes muxed and D mode. There is a bus
              turnaround delay of 2 FMC clock cycle between: Two
              consecutive synchronous write operations (in Burst or
              Single mode) to the same bank. A synchronous write
              (burst or single) access and an asynchronous write or
              read transfer to or from static memory bank (the bank
              can be the same or a different one in case of a read
              operation. Two consecutive synchronous read
              operations (in Burst or Single mode) followed by any
              synchronous/asynchronous read or write from/to

          <description>This register contain the current error
          correction code value computed by the ECC computation
          modules of the FMC NAND controller. When the CPU
          reads/writes the data from a NAND Flash memory page at
          the correct address (refer to Section20.8.6: Computation
          of the error correction code (ECC) in NAND Flash memory),
          the data read/written from/to the NAND Flash memory are
          processed automatically by the ECC computation module.
          When X bytes have been read (according to the ECCPS field
          in the FMC_PCR registers), the CPU must read the computed
          ECC value from the FMC_ECC registers. It then verifies if
          these computed parity data are the same as the parity
          value recorded in the spare area, to determine whether a
          page is valid, and, to correct it otherwise. The FMC_ECCR
          register should be cleared after being read by setting
          the ECCEN bit to 0. To compute a new data block, the
          ECCEN bit must be set to 1.</description>

              low): (BUSTRUN + 1) KCK_FMC period &amp;#8805;
              tEHELmin. The programmed bus turnaround delay is
              inserted between a an asynchronous write transfer and
              any other asynchronous /synchronous read or write
              transfer to or from a static bank. If a read
              operation is performed, the bank can be the same or a

              of write operation to the bank, except in muxed mode

              between two consecutive asynchronous write transfers
              to the same static memory bank except for muxed mode
